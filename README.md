*Crapibara*

**Intro**
crapibara, a stupendously slow, archaic, useless, language written for fun in python without any caffeine
is a bad choice for a senior, junior, student programmer, if you want to use it _suffer_ if you wanna edit
or make along me _suffer_ also but most importantly it's a crap as the name suggests

**how to use**
Download the main.py and run it there you can type:
>crapibara (Filename.cb)
and it will run the file

**syntax**
im too lazy you people find out yourself for how
